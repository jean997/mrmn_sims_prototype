# Prototype for MRMN simulation system

Directions: 

- Download `bench1_files.txt`, `run_benchmark.dsc`, `collect.R`
- If necessary install DSC.
- Write your MR method as a function called `mr_method` in a file called `mr_method.R` (see example). 
- Run the command `dsc run_benchmark.dsc`. 
- Run `RScript collect.R` 

Results will be in `bench1_result.RDS`
